# Active Context

## Current Project Status
AR-Квиз in its current state is actively being developed and optimized. We are focused on fixing issues with marker mode AR (based on marker Hiro).

## Current Focus
- Stabilization of marker mode AR (based on marker Hiro)
- Correct display of colored objects without artifacts
- Correct interaction with objects (clicks/taps on objects)
- Stable positioning of objects relative to marker
- Sequential level progression system

## Available Resources
- Research on AR.js capabilities (in research/arjs.md)
- Example marker-based implementations (in marker/)
- Sample quiz interface (in quiz/)
- Project requirements (in README.md)
- Comprehensive UI/UX design documentation
- Detailed architecture and algorithm design plans
- Dual-mode support (Location-based and Marker-based)

## Development Priorities
1. Marker mode AR with interaction and stabilization (current priority)
2. Saving progress and sequential level progression system
3. Testing on different devices
4. Performance optimization

## Current Challenges
- Fixing issues with black/shadowed objects in marker mode
- Ensuring correct interaction with objects
- Stabilizing object position relative to marker
- Creating an intuitive progression system

## Dual AR Mode Implementation
The project supports two AR modes:
1. Marker mode (based on marker Hiro) - current priority
2. Non-marker mode (with virtual coordinates)

Marker mode provides more stable results and allows users to play the quiz by pointing their camera at a special marker. 3D objects appear above the marker, and the user can interact with them.
